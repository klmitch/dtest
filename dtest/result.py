Test Results
============

This module contains the DTestResult and DTestMessage classes, which
are used to represent the results of tests.  Instances of DTestResult
contain the current state of a test, whether the test was successful
or if an error was encountered, and any exceptions and output messages
that were generated while running the test.  The output messages are
contained in an instance of DTestMessage.

    DTestResult
    ===========

    The DTestResult class stores the current state of a test, as well
    as the results and output messages of a test and its immediate
    fixtures.  Various special methods are implemented, allowing the
    result to appear True if the test passed and False if the test did
    not pass, as well as allowing the messages to be accessed easily.
    Three public properties are available: the ``test`` property
    returns the associated test; the ``state`` property returns the
    state of the test, which can also indicate the final result; and
    the ``msgs`` property returns a list of the messages generated
    while executing the test.

    Note that the string representation of a DTestResult object is
    identical to its state.

    Test messages
    -------------

    Messages can be emitted during three separate phases of test
    execution.  The first step of executing a test is to execute the
    setUp() method defined for the class; the second step is executing
    the test itself; and the third step is to execute the tearDown()
    method defined for the class.  (The setUp() and tearDown() methods
    used can be set or overridden using the setUp() and tearDown()
    decorators of DTest.)  Messages produced by each phase are saved,
    and are identified by the constants PRE, TEST, and POST,
    respectively.  This could be used to warn a developer that,
    although a test passed, the following tearDown() function failed
    for some reason.

    The list of test message objects (instances of class DTestMessage)
    can be retrieved, in the order (PRE, TEST, POST), using the
    ``msgs`` property, as indicated above.  Additionally, the presence
    of each type of message can be discerned with the ``in`` operator
    (e.g., ``PRE in result``), and the message itself retrieved using
    array accessor syntax (e.g., ``result[TEST]``).  The total number
    of messages available can be determined using the len() operator.

    Context Handler
    ---------------

    Instances of DTestResult are context handlers, usable with the
    Python ``with`` statement.  This is used deep within the DTest
    class to collect and send the output into the correct DTestMessage
    object.  A DTestResult object should *never* be used in a ``with``
    statement without first calling the accumulate() method with a
    valid origin (one of the constants PRE, TEST, or POST).  For
    convenience, accumulate() returns the DTestResult object, allowing
    it to be used directly in the ``with`` statement.  This is an
    internal interface, and test developers should not need to use it.
