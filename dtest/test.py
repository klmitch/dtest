Tests
=====

This module contains all the classes and decorators necessary for
manipulating tests.  The DTestBase class is the root of the
inheritance tree for DTest and DTestFixture, which respectively
represent tests and test fixtures.  The DTestCaseMeta class is a
metaclass for DTestCase, which is equivalent to unittest.TestCase for
the dependency-based test framework.  This module also contains a
number of decorators, such as @istest, @nottest, @skip, @failing,
@attr(), @depends(), @raises(), and @timed(), along with the debugging
utility function dot().

    DTestBase
    =========

    The DTestBase class is a base class for the DTest and DTestFixture
    classes, and contains a number of common elements.  Most users
    will only be interested in the attribute manipulation methods,
    which allows attributes to be attached to tests (see also the
    @attr() decorator); the stringification method, which generates a
    string name for the test based on the function or method wrapped
    by the DTestBase instance; and the following properties:

    :result:
        The result of the most recent test run; may be None if the
        test has not yet been run.

    :state:
        The state of the most recent test run; may be None if the test
        has not yet been run.

    :test:
        The actual function or method implementing the test.

    :class_:
        If the test is a method of a class, this property will be the
        appropriate class; otherwise, None.

    :skip:
        True if the @skip decorator has been used on the test.

    :failing:
        True if the @failing decorator has been used on the test.

    :dependencies:
        The tests this test is dependent on.

    :dependents:
        The tests that are dependent on this test.

    :raises:
        The set of exceptions this test can raise; declared using the
        @raises() decorator.

    :timeout:
        The timeout set for this test; declared using the @timed()
        decorator.

    In addition, the setUp() and tearDown() methods are available to
    identify special set up and tear down functions or methods to
    override the class-level setUp() and tearDown() methods; these
    methods may be used as decorators, assuming the test has been
    decorated with the @istest decorator.  There is also an istest()
    method, which by default returns False; this is overridden by the
    DTest class to return True.
